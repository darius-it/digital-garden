title: Welcome to my digital garden ðŸª´
---

Hi there, and welcome to my cozy corner of the Internet. Here I will collect a bunch of little pieces of information, from thoughts and ideas to random things that interest me.

## Who am I?
I'm Darius, a passionate student from Germany. I have a variety of interests such reading (mostly sci-fi) books, listening to music from all around the world (with a focus on niche artists from Asia), but most importantly, great interest in anything about technology. 

If you are interested in any of these topics, feel free to click on the words marked in blue to learn more about them.

## What even is a digital garden?
To be honest with you, I am currently in the process of figuring this out myself. From what I have read (and what I expect this place to be) a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is a collection with bits and pieces of various information, which is not structured strictly hierarchically, but can rather be arranged in a way that makes more sense for oneself.

So feel free to come along and join me on the ride of exploring this way of digital note taking.

## Any questions?
If you have any questions or want to get in touch, feel free to leave a comment on this page.
In the future, I am also planning to get an email under this exact domain, but until then comments will be the only way you can reach me. 

Do not ask me about any social media - I am present on some platforms but only share my accounts with close friends.
